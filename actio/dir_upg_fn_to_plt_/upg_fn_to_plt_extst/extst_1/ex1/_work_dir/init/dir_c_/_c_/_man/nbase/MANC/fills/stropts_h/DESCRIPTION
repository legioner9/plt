I_SENDFD
Pass a file descriptor through a STREAMS pipe.
I_RECVFD

I_LIST
Get all the module names on a STREAM.
I_ATMARK
Is the top message "marked''?
I_CKBAND
See if any messages exist in a band.
I_GETBAND
Get the band of the top message on a STREAM.
I_CANPUT
Is a band writable?
I_SETCLTIME

At least the following macros shall be defined for use with I_LOOK:

FMNAMESZ
The minimum size in bytes of the buffer referred to by the arg argument.
At least the following macros shall be defined for use with I_FLUSH:

FLUSHR
Flush read queues.
FLUSHW
Flush write queues.
FLUSHRW
Flush read and write queues.
At least the following macros shall be defined for use with I_SETSIG:

S_RDNORM
A normal (priority band set to 0) message has arrived at the head of a STREAM head read queue.
S_RDBAND
A message with a non-zero priority band has arrived at the head of a STREAM head read queue.
S_INPUT
A message, other than a high-priority message, has arrived at the head of a STREAM head read queue.
S_HIPRI
A high-priority message is present on a STREAM head read queue.
S_OUTPUT
The write queue for normal data (priority band 0) just below the STREAM head is no longer full. This notifies the process that there is room on the queue for sending (or writing) normal data downstream.
S_WRNORM
Equivalent to S_OUTPUT.
S_WRBAND
The write queue for a non-zero priority band just below the STREAM head is no longer full.
S_MSG
A STREAMS signal message that contains the SIGPOLL signal reaches the front of the STREAM head read queue.
S_ERROR
Notification of an error condition reaches the STREAM head.
S_HANGUP
Notification of a hangup reaches the STREAM head.
S_BANDURG
When used in conjunction with S_RDBAND, SIGURG is generated instead of SIGPOLL when a priority message reaches the front of the STREAM head read queue.
At least the following macros shall be defined for use with I_PEEK:

RS_HIPRI
Only look for high-priority messages.
At least the following macros shall be defined for use with I_SRDOPT:

RNORM
Byte-STREAM mode, the default.
RMSGD
Message-discard mode.
RMSGN
Message-non-discard mode.
RPROTNORM
Fail read() with [EBADMSG] if a message containing a control part is at the front of the STREAM head read queue.
RPROTDAT
Deliver the control part of a message as data when a process issues a read().
RPROTDIS
Discard the control part of a message, delivering any data part, when a process issues a read().
At least the following macros shall be defined for use with I_SWOPT:

SNDZERO
Send a zero-length message downstream when a write() of 0 bytes occurs.
At least the following macros shall be defined for use with I_ATMARK:

ANYMARK
Check if the message is marked.
LASTMARK
Check if the message is the last one marked on the queue.
At least the following macros shall be defined for use with I_UNLINK:

MUXID_ALL
Unlink all STREAMs linked to the STREAM associated with fildes.
The following macros shall be defined for getmsg(), getpmsg(), putmsg(), and putpmsg():

MSG_ANY
Receive any message.
MSG_BAND
Receive message from specified band.
MSG_HIPRI
Send/receive high-priority message.
MORECTL
More control information is left in message.
MOREDATA
More data is left in message.
The <stropts.h> header may make visible all of the symbols from <unistd.h>.

The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
